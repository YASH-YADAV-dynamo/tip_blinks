## What is it?

The main use of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way to mint compressed NFTs on the Solana blockchain. This can be useful for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana blockchain, as well as for users who want to create and manage their own NFTs.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
